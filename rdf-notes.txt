Apparently, gutenberg.org does not allow crawlers on its site. Curling a page from gutenberg shows
a comment pointing to an rdf file for anyone who wants to trawl through gutenberg data (like me!).
I have included the rdf file here.

The rdf file isn't organized as I expected. The file has two parts: a bunch of `pgterms:etext`, which
contains the "library catalog" data for a book, and then a bunch of `pgterms:file` which is what we
are interested in---the actual ebook files. The `pgterms:etext` and `pgterms:file` is linked by
rdf:ID (`pgterms:etext`) and rdf:resource (`pgterms:file`).
